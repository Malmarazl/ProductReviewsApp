# ProductReviewsApp

Application to show products, details products, and reviews for each product.

First of all, I would like to say that I had some problems with the docker that you sent to me related to the installation,
it was not possible to launch the docker script without modifying the script, the path for Windows was wrong, 
for this reason, I had to apply changes to it and created each item in the database by myself, this is not a complaint, I just say that in order to avoid possible problems for future candidates.

About the application.
I decided to use MVVM pattern for the project instead of using a normal MVP pattern, I think observers are a faster way to communicate between views and allow the developer to control all the logic data into the ViewModel to return clean data to the view.
The application has a MainActivity that contains a frame layout where I show the fragments (HomeFragment and DetailFragment) in my opinion, work with one Activity and Fragments reduces the possibility of losing data. (Of course, there is a SplasScreen Activity too, but it only appears for a few seconds)
The connections with the server work with Retrofit library and Gson for parsing, about this point, I had to use a static IP for the API calls, I have never work with docker before and that one was the best approach that I was able to find, that means that would be necessary to modify the paths for the API calls
(for reviews and products) otherwise, the app will show an error screen always. (In addition, I had to include a manifest param to allow "HTTP" calls)
I added Glide to load images
I did not add testing because I donÂ´t have any experience with it, I know that it is a huge lack of knowledge but is something that I would like to improve as soon as possible.
Each functionality was developed on an independent branch to be merged later into main.
